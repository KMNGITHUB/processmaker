# File Download Control Settings

## Control Description

The File Download control adds an area in the ProcessMaker Screen from which the form user can download one or more files to a local computer. The downloaded file\(s\) can be referenced from a previous step in the Request.

## Add the Control to a ProcessMaker Screen <a id="add-the-control-to-a-processmaker-screen"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
Your user account or group membership must have the following permissions to add a control to a ProcessMaker Screen:

* Screens: View Screens
* Screens: Edit Screens

See the ProcessMaker [Screens](../../../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#screens) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to add this control to the ProcessMaker Screen:

1. View the ProcessMaker Screen page to which to add the control.
2. Go to the **Controls** panel on the left side of the ProcessMaker Screen.
3. Drag the **File Download** icon![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/file-download-control-screens-builder-processes.png)from the **Controls** panel anywhere within the ProcessMaker Screen canvas represented by the dotted-lined box. Existing controls on the ProcessMaker Screen canvas adjust positioning based on where you drag the control.
4. Place into the ProcessMaker Screen canvas where you want the control to display on the page.

5. Configure the File Download control. See [Inspector Settings](file-download-control-settings.md#inspector-settings).

Below is a File Download control in Preview mode.



## Delete the Control from a ProcessMaker Screen

{% hint style="warning" %}
Deleting a control also deletes configuration for that control. If you add another control, it will have default settings.
{% endhint %}

Click the **Delete** icon![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/delete-screen-control-screens-builder-processes.png)for the control to delete it.

## Inspector Settings <a id="inspector-settings"></a>

### Permissions Required

Your user account or group membership must have the following permissions to edit a ProcessMaker Screen control:

* Screens: View Screens
* Screens: Edit Screens

See the ProcessMaker [Screens](../../../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#screens) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

Below are Inspector settings for the File Download control:

* **Text Label:** Enter the field label text that displays. **New File Download** is the default value.
* **Download Name:** Enter the name associated with the downloaded file\(s\). This name can be referenced from a previous step in the Process. This setting has no default value.
* **Visibility Rule:** Enter an expression that dictates the condition\(s\) under which this control displays. See [Expression Syntax Components for "Visibility Rule" Control Settings](expression-syntax-components-for-show-if-control-settings.md#expression-syntax-components-for-show-if-control-settings). If this setting does not have an expression, then this control displays by default.
* **CSS Selector Name:** Enter the value to represent this control in custom CSS syntax when in [Custom CSS](../add-custom-css-to-a-screen.md#add-custom-css-to-a-processmaker-screen) mode. As a best practice, use the same **CSS Selector Name** value on different controls to have the same custom CSS applied.
